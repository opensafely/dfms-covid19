This is the code and configuration for the effect of COVID-19 on prescribing of Dependence Forming Medicines and the associated health utilisation.

* This work will be published as a PrescQIPP Hot Topic and will be available to view on the PrescQIPP website [here](https://www.prescqipp.info).
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, will be made available to view [here](https://jobs.opensafely.org/prescqipp/effect-of-covid-19-on-prescribing-of-dependence-forming-medicines-and-the-associated-health-utilisation//).
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
